# Introduction to JS

## Intro
- Used on vast majority of websites
- Can create many other kinds of apps
- TypeScript is a superset of JS, Cordova, Electron, node.js
- multi-platform language

## Install
- install Git
- install npm from node.js
- VS Code

## Hello World
- package.json has the dependencies required by this repo
- teacher noted there are sometimes issues with issuing npm within VS Code's terminal - I have had times where I needed to reinstall. Consider doing this outside the integrated terminal in the future.
- ```npm run start``` will invoke the Light Server - it has a good hot refresh

## Sample Website for course
- need to perform npm install per directory used, since it relies on the package.json for instructions
