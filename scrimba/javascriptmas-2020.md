# Javascriptmas 2020 from Scrimba

Day 01: Candies: https://t.co/DKfJfNvfsn?amp=1  
I returned to capture my learning from all of the challenges and found this one didn't save so I solved it a second time! I hope it will still count since I didn't discover it until December 18!

Day 02: Deposit Profit: https://t.co/h1ZUh3Br1Y?amp=1  
Thanks to the video and instructions, I was able to solve this one very well. It gave me another boost of confidence to continue.

Day 03: Chunky Monkey: https://t.co/bods2fv131?amp=1  
I enjoyed learning how to solve this! Once I finished the solution and saw the lovely output, I was quite pleased.

Day 04: Century From Year: https://t.co/DbadZtx6vD?amp=1  
I solve this by testing the year portion of the century. I spoke with my elegant code co-worker and he pointed out I missed the hint about Math.floor(). Doh! It stills works if it is a bit crunchy.

Day 05: Reverse A String: https://t.co/TsY6Ix8o0b?amp=1  
The solution to this code presented itself quite neatly in my brain. It's so nice to feel like this knowledge is gaining traction!

Day 06: Sort By Length: https://t.co/kZc3oShVgq?amp=1  
I know I had seen this code written in many places but this was the first chance to apply it. It seems so simple while also complex; functions used like this seem to be the heart of JS!

Day 07: Count Vowel Consonant: https://t.co/hr9vz9Dolb?amp=1  
It was fun to work with a .reduce() function in this solution. I had shied away from them previously but found an example I understood and could apply.

Day 08: The Rolling Dice: https://t.co/dhzOVfhVUs?amp=1  
Wow, this was HARD! This is the challenge that almost made me throw in the towel. Honestly, I could not figure out any other way to do this at the time than adding extra markup to the HTML. I was pleased I was able to construct everything well enough that it did work. An excellent learning opportunity but I sure worked for it!

Day 09: Sum Odd Fibonacci Numbers: https://t.co/3Y5kXIQt92?amp=1  
Oh boy, this one was ugly!! I Googled some Fibonacci generation solutions but I still had to put in an ugly `break` within my code. In the end, the solution was accurate and I learned more about generating the Fibonacci sequence.

Day 10: Adjacent Elements Product: https://t.co/KawUiYgCnp?amp=1  
The first opportunity to use the spread syntax - it's fun. I'm wondering if I could have written this with a forEach loop; I might have to try it sometime.

Day 11: Avoid Obstacles: https://t.co/Cqp0zZJZwZ?amp=1  
I added this comment to my code:
```Javascript
// Why does this only work as a constant and can't be a regular function?// This version I found in Google works, so let's do it!
```
I still regularly try to reason why one would use a `const` declaration instead of a `let` declaration. I always try to avoid a `var` declaration! This one hung me up for some small amount of time.

Day 12: Valid Time: https://t.co/ZUgveLvfT5?amp=1  
I felt very prepared for this solution because as a data developer by long experience, 24 hour time and I get along very well. Nothing like knowing your array length so you can set your indexes hard-coded.

Day 13: Extract Each Kth: https://t.co/VYUZI67Ezy?amp=1  
I discussed this briefly with the elegant code co-worker because I felt like my solution was odd. They had a similar solution (but more elegant, because that's how they roll!) so I felt better about what I wrote. Any opportunity to properly use modulo is a good one.

Day 14: Maximal Adjacent Difference: https://t.co/zToEtaMWvG?amp=1  
I got to use the array spread syntax again!! It immediately came to mind - I feel like my JS knowledge is really growing.

Day 15: Carousel: https://t.co/KAUGrKPzYH?amp=1  
My solution could have been a bit tighter. I mean, storing those positions in the array was silly but it didn't look like my slides were running right. I was happy to come up with a solution that worked so well and I can ALMOST code a click handler without looking.

Day 16: Insert Dashes: https://t.co/hKHQBfagjn?amp=1  
I felt brilliant after I solved this one. It looks like one of the picture-perfect solutions the elegante developer would write. Just lovely!

Day 17: Different Symbols Naive: https://t.co/0jBMiqDMmO?amp=1  
I loved this one! I felt like the logic was right up my alley. Although there may be an even more terse way to solve it, I loved that I was able to quickly code my way to a passing solution.

Day 18: Array Previous Less: https://t.co/ipGMcVzWCb?amp=1  
At this point, I feel really comfortable with using forEach on my arrays. It's kind of fun to find the functional use of functions like .unshift().

Day 19: Alphabet Subsequence: https://t.co/eGjFBtYLdj?amp=1  
I tried for a while in the morning to solve with set size and codeCharAt but just couldn't figure out how I could do it. I was able to find a way to pass the tests so I went with that one. This took longer than I expected but I enjoyed the practice time.

Day 20: Domain Type: https://t.co/Gra0BpmyQ5?amp=1  
I solved this one FAST! If I hadn't deleted a piece of my code instead of a `console.log` statement, it would have been even faster! My mind immediately jumped to an array method that could be used and all I had to do was type it out. I need to keep this success in my list of affirmations for tougher days!

Day 21: Sum of 2: https://t.co/xgLEcUuLrL?amp=1  
I simply could not figure out how to solve this with hasOwnProperty(). I tried running a classic double loop but it just didn't seem to work. I hacked together a solution with forEach and map. It may not be concise but it works to solve the challenge.

Day 22: Extract Matrix Column: https://t.co/fADkiW6ggd?amp=1  
This solution came to me accidentally as I did my normal start logging out the parameters. It was kind of cool to solve so fast!!
